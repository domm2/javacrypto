FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
 To start Group Server: java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the
 first and only group so far, ADMIN. The group server will by default select
 (and print out) a random port, but a custom port can be passed as the first
 command line argument.

 To start the File Server: java RunFileServer [(optional) port number] The file
 server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one does not
 exist. The file server is now online. The file server will by default select
 (and print out) a random port, but a custom port can be passed as the first
 command line argument.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin and GroupList.bin

To start the CLI application: 
java Driver [file_server_ip] [file_server_port] [group_server_ip] [group_server_port]
The user will first be asked for their name and will receive a token. 
After, the user may use 'help to read instructions on how to use the application.
